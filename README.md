## Technologies Used
1. React
2. React-Redux + Thunk

I used React-Redux + Thunk to store all information in the state so I didn't have to keep fetching the data.  The Redux store has all fetched data in its state so I continually reused old data.  

I want to try styling it when I have free time so that it looks more complete.  It is definitely barebones but I completed most of the functionalities.
